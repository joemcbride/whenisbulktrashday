Hello! My name is Joe McBride and I'm a Software Craftsman working out of Las Vegas Nevada. I have a passion for UI and love to bring to life designer's creations. I dabble in just about every technology and love new tech, though lately I've focused on JavaScript and Objective-C/Swift.

My enthusiasm for programming and software architecture was cultivated by writing scripts to automate my character in text-based MUDs in high school (and secretly still engage in). I have run variations of this site since 2004 and can be followed on twitter as [@uicraftsman](http://twitter.com/uicraftsman).
